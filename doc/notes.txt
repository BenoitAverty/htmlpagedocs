================== THINGS TO PUT IN THE FRAMEWORK ==================

The framework will contain style info that should stay as-is in most cases (of course 
everything can be overriten, but some things won't be in practice for basic usage).

--- Misc ---

* Paper size


--- Images ---
* Classes for images position (center, floating, ...)
* Classes for images layout (caption)
* Figure numbering

--- Tables ---
* Table numbering
* Classes for table caption

====== THING TO PUT IN THE FRAMEWORK AND TO OVERRIDE IN THEME ======

--- Titles hierarchy ---
* Define what corresponds to each html heading level. (e.g for a book : h1 is book title, h2 is part, h3 is chapter)
* Define layout for headings level (page breaks, String setting for header/footer, ...)
* Part/Chapter counters
